# pythonProject
This repository is dedicated to the project within the python and R for data science Lab.
The file API.py represents the first step of the project, which is collecting data from an API.
The data chosen is from the Art institute of Chicago. We collected 1500 observations (artworks).
Before collecting the data, we chose the features we deemed important for our analysis. To do so, we edited the URL using 'fields'.
We then set the limit of the page to 100 instead of the default 12 to facilitate looping.
Finally, we extracted the data from 15 pages, and then we merged them all in a new file.
